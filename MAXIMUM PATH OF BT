A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.



class Solution {
    int max=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    public int maxheight(TreeNode root){
        if(root==null) return 0;
       int leftsum=maxheight(root.left);
       int rightsum = maxheight(root.right);
       max=Math.max(max,leftsum+rightsum+root.val);
       return Math.max(leftsum,rightsum)+root.val;
    }
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        maxheight(root);
        return max;
    }
}
