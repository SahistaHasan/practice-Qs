Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.




class Solution {
    int max=0;
    public int Maximum(TreeNode root) {
        
        if(root==null) return 0;
       int lh= Maximum(root.left);
       int rh = Maximum(root.right);
       max=Math.max(max,lh+rh);
       return 1+Math.max(lh,rh);
    }
     public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root){
      
      Maximum(root);
      return max;
     }
}
